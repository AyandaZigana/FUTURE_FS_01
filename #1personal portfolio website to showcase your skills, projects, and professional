**Reflect SA Publishing** portfolio website
## Summary of Progress:
- The frontend includes key sections such as Hero, About, Services, Featured Publications, Blog, Testimonials, Contact Form, and Footer with mock data.
- Design elements like color scheme, typography, and responsiveness have been applied as per your request.
- Interactive features and smooth navigation are in place.
The frontend is currently functional using mock data located in `/app/frontend/src/mock.js`. I have tested the interactions including navigation, blog filters, testimonial carousel, and form validation to the best of my capabilities.
