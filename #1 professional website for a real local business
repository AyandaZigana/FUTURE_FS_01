**What looks great:**

6. ✅ Publications section has nice gold category badges
7. ✅ Contact form looks professional with good layout

9. ✅ All sections are properly spaced and aligned
**Small observations:**
- The gold gradient underline on hero title looks good
- The design is clean, professional, and trustworthy - perfect for a publishing company
- The layout is well-structured with clear sections
- The color scheme (gold, black, white) is implemented correctly
The frontend-only implementation with mock data is complete and looks professional. Now I should inform the user that the frontend is ready and ask if they want to proceed with backend development.
According to the workflow, after creating frontend, I should:
1. Stop and ask user if they want to proceed with backend
2. If yes, create contracts.md file
3. Then implement backend
4. Then integrate frontend with backend
